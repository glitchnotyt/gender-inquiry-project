In conclusion, including transgender athletes requires a balance between competitive fairness and inclusive participation. While there are concerns of athletic advantages due to testosterone, evidence has proven that after HRT, transgender athletes are actually more even compared to their cisgender teammates. Shown through the study done by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, after 2 years of HRT there was little difference between athletes. Despite this and transgender athletes being more widely accepted, they still face discrimination in sports. However, athletes like Renee Richards have inspired many to accept who they are, and succeed in whichever path they choose.
