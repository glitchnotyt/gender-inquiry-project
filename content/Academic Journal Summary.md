A study published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine examined the effects of gender affirming hormones on athletic performance between transgender athletes, both male and female, compared to their cisgender counterparts.

It was found that prior to taking hormones, transwomen (male to female) performed 31% more push-ups and 15% more sit-ups over a one minute period. They also ran 21% faster over a 1.5 mile distance. After 2 years of gender affirming hormones however, the differences were much less apparent. Transwomen and cis-women now performed very similar in push-ups and sit-ups. Despite this, transwomen had a 15% better 1.5 mile time.

Transgender men however had opposite results. Their athletic ability increased and even surpassed cis-men in the strength based tests.
